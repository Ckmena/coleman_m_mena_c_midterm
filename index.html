		<h3> Why Colour Pictures Are Better</h3>

			<ul>
				<li> Coloured pictures make the picture look more realistc</li>
				<li> Photographters can use colour to highlight an object, or even make it blend in, however sometimes black and white can be distracting.</li>
				<li> Pictures are often easier to look at when coloured because our brains are used to seeing everything in colour.</li>
				<li> You can often see the emotions more clear in a coloured picture compared to black and white picture.</li>
